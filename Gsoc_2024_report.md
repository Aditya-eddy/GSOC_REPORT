## Project Description

Writing unit test cases can be challenging and sometimes inefficient. Keploy streamlines this process by creating backend API tests with built-in mocks or stubs, recording your application's network calls to make testing faster and more efficient than traditional unit tests.

This project focuses on developing a console for Keploy that allows users to gain hands-on experience with the platform. The console enables users to capture test cases, replay them, and test with their preferred libraries, all within an interactive and user-friendly environment. Additionally, the console includes an integrated terminal for logs, providing real-time insights into the testing process. To keep users informed, the console also features web stories that provide the latest updates and news about Keploy.

## My Contribution to Keploy (GSOC-Project)

I undertook the challenge of developing key components for Keploy, specifically the **WebStories** feature and the **Keploy UI Console**.

### WebStories
I developed the WebStories feature , for displaying web-stories related to the testing and keploy. This involved:
- Designing and developing the UI components.
- Managing the states to work synchronously with images. 

PRs:
- [Webstories-1](https://github.com/keploy/website/commit/26542e6c744893c7465acc4f104a2920b383ce8a)
- [Webstories-2](https://github.com/keploy/website/pull/66)

### Keploy UI Console
I also worked on enhancing the Keploy UI Console, focusing on improving user interaction and interface design, which included:
- Streamlining the console layout for better user experience.
- Integrating the keploy software using the graphql queries. Fetching the real-time logs from the backend. Displaying in the terminal.

- **Expanding Language Support**: I aim to extend the functionality of Keploy by adding support for more programming languages, starting with Java. This will make the tool more versatile and accessible to a broader range of developers.

## Challenges and Takeaways

Working on the Keploy console project was both challenging and rewarding. From the outset, I delved deep into understanding the intricacies of integrating real-time logging, enhancing user experience with interactive web stories, and ensuring seamless API test case management. These features demanded a thorough understanding of front-end technologies, which I developed through hands-on experience.

One of the key challenges was optimizing the console's efficiency while maintaining a user-friendly interface.
This project honed my skills in problem-solving, efficient coding, and UI skills. My ability to write clean, maintainable code improved significantly, as did my understanding of how to design a robust and scalable application. The feedback and guidance from my mentors were invaluable in helping me overcome obstacles and achieve the projectâ€™s goals with high quality.
